## Challenge
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

´´´SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1´´´

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.


## Solution
Sarted off trying to get a php query so I could try to detect SQL injection vulnerability. I selected the "Accessories" category. Then the link updated to a php query.

![](/assets/images/ps-sql-lab1/labimg2.png)

Then I tried a basic payloads suchas as ´´´' or 1=1-- -´´´ after the php query link.
