## 1.1 – The OSI Model
• What is the OSI model?
– Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model
• It’s a guide (thus the term “model”)
– Don’t get wrapped up in the details
• This is not the OSI protocol suite
– Most of the OSI protocols didn’t catch on
• There are unique protocols at every layer
• You’ll refer to this model for the rest of your career
– Often
• All People Seem To Need Data Processing

### Layer 1 – Physical Layer
• The physics of the network
– Signaling, cabling, connectors
– This layer isn’t about protocols
• “You have a physical layer problem.”
– Fix your cabling, punch-downs, etc.
– Run loopback tests, test/replace cables, swap adapter cards

### Layer 2 – Data Link Layer
• The basic network “language”
– The foundation of communication at the data link layer
• Data Link Control (DLC) protocols
– MAC (Media Access Control) address on Ethernet
• The “switching” layer

### Layer 3 – Network Layer
• The “routing” layer
• Internet Protocol (IP)
• Fragments frames to traverse different networks

### Layer 4 – Transport Layer
• The “post office” layer
– Parcels and letters
• TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### Layer 5 – Session Layer
• Communication management between devices
– Start, stop, restart
• Control protocols, tunneling protocols

### Layer 6 – Presentation Layer
• Character encoding
• Application encryption
• Often combined with the Application Layer

### Layer 7 – Application Layer
• The layer we see
• HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3

• Follow the conversation
